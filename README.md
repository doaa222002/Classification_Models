# Classification_Models
This project applies various classification techniques, including SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. The models are used to classify data into categories, with performance evaluated using metrics like Accuracy Score and a detailed Classification Report to compare their strengths and weaknesses.
